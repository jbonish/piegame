What is PieGame about?

Pie Game is a game about preserving your pie and staying alive. Just like real life! You are an ant who has found a delicious pie. Evil flies and mice want to eat your pie so you must defend it for as long as you can.

How do I play?

You play by staying alive for as long as you can. To defeat a mouse you must tap it. To defeat a fly you must swipe it away. Donâ€™t mix these up because swiping a mouse or tapping a fly will only make them angry and want to take more of your pie. Save your pie and defeat these vile creatures.

FOR THE COLONY!!!
