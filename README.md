ben's notes:

	i started working in c# because i couldnt get js to work for the life of me.  it would
	probably be pretty easy to switch if thats something we wanted to do, but c# is pretty
	straighforward as well.  i don't really care. jimmy you probably feel more strongly
	than i do.

	i made a thing that has one fly that goes towards the center and an ant that follows 
	 the mouse.  in the real game the mouse position would be switched with the tap or
	swipe location.  also we can obviously change images/make things transparent at will.

	i started to look at how to randomly spawn enemies but didnt get all taht far.  as far
	as i know now it involves making the enemies prefab objects (which i did) which i guess
	allows you to attach scripts to them.  and one script i guess we would attach is where
	to spawn enemies.  

	unity is cool

	unity is WEIRD
