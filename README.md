it's piegame
=======

ben's notes:

	things that need doing:
		1.  images.  we need to fix the fly one (and add dynamite), maybe change the
		wood background to a picnic blanket on grass or something, fix the transparency
		of the pie, add an explosion animation sprite sheet (i put in two, but we
		need to play around with them) and change any images we dont like.

		
		2.  damage.  right now the flies do periodic damage and the mice do continuous
		which i like but we need to decide if we want to damage the pie via just making
		it smaller or actually taking out pieces. 

		3.  intro/game over screens.  no idea how to go about doing these but i bet 
		unity has a simple way.
	
		4.  some method of score keeping.  it could just be time survived?


		5.  actually use phone input not just mouse clicking.

		6.  in the enemy spawner make the spawn rate speed up as the game goes on. 
		maybe also make the enemies move faster?  or do more damage?
